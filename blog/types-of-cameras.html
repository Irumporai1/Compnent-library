            <p>Evolution of cameras in the last 2 decades is huge. From film cameras to smart phone

            <h2>Full-frame camera</h2>
            <p>
                A full-frame camera is a camera with a full-frame sensor. This is an image sensor that's the same size as the sensor of an 
                analog camera. The biggest advantage of a full-frame camera is that it has no crop factor. Crop factor means that the image is cut out because the sensor is too small to capture the entire image.
                Full-frame cameras can deliver higher resolution. So when you have to print very large size photographs, it will be helpful. Full-frame cameras are used by professional photographers.
            </p>

            <h2>APS-C or Crop Sensor camera</h2>
            <p>
                The more popular APS-C(Advanced Photo System type-C) sensor size found in most DSLRs and mirrorless cameras measures 22 x 15mm. This means a full-frame sensor has more than 2.5 times the surface 
                area of an APS-C sensor.One big advantage of APS-C sensors is that the cameras that have them are smaller and lighter than a full frame camera. So if you like to do street photography, compactness 
                may be just what you need. You'll be able to capture the atmosphere and your subject while remaining inconspicuous. Cost is also less compared to full-frame cameras. Most suitable for photography ethusiasists and hobbyists.

            <h2>Action camera</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Based on your budget and requirements you can choose your camera. If you just care about selfies and a few snaps around the parties 
                then any good smart phone camera will do the job.
