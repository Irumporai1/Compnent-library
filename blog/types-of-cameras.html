            <p>Evolution of cameras in the last 2 decades is huge. From film cameras to smart phone

            <h2>Full-frame camera</h2>
            <p>
                A full-frame camera is a camera with a full-frame sensor.
                The biggest advantage of a full-frame camera is that it has no crop factor. Crop factor means that the image is cut out because the sensor is too small to capture the entire image.
                Full-frame cameras can deliver higher resolution.  So when you have to print very large size photographs, it will be helpful. But the cost of lenses for full-frame camera is very high. Full-frame cameras are used by professional photographers.

            <h2>APS-C or Crop Sensor camera</h2>
            <p>
                APS-C(Advanced Photo System type-C) sensors are small in size compared to full-frame camera sensors. Full-frame sensor are 2.5x(approx.) times bigger than crop sensors.
                These sensors are used in DSLRs and mirrorless cameras.
                One big advantage of APS-C sensors is that the cameras are smaller and lighter than a full frame camera. So it is mostly used for street photography. 
                With smaller cameras you'll be able to capture the atmosphere and your subject without noticed by anyone. Cost is also less compared to full-frame cameras. Most suitable for photography ethusiasists and hobbyists.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
